cwapadminbot
============

`cwapadminbot` is a Telegram bot build developed to run the Come Wiv a Plan (CWAP) Telegram groups. Come Wiv a Plan is a
competitive team of Boom Beach players. Come Wiv a Plan has had global leaderboard success for Mega Crab, VP, and 
Warships. A well run Telegram group is needed for highly competitive game play on Boom Beach and this bot was developed 
to organize and run all competive teams.

If you are interested in joining and becoming a member of a CWAP group please refer to the 
[@joincwap](https://t.me/joincwap) Telegram channel.

## How to contribute

#### Translations

If you want to translate a message into your native language, you can look at the [cwapadminbot.py](https://github.com/scipio314/cwapadminbot/blob/master/src/cwapadminbot/cwapadminbot.py) file and look for message you'd like translated. There is an edit button on github where you can go into edit mode. Any changes made are reviewed by myself before being implemented.

#### Adding or modifying functions

Here is how you can create and modify functions:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/cwapadminbot
cd cwapadminbot
```

3. Add a track to the original repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cwapadminbot
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Once installed you can begin making code changes. When your changes are finished you can push to your github and start
a pull request. I will review the changes and if no comments I will accept them.
