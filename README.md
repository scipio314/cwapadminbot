cwapadminbot
============

`cwapadminbot` is a Telegram bot build developed to run the Come Wiv a Plan (CWAP) Telegram groups. Come Wiv a Plan is a
competitive team of Boom Beach players. Come Wiv a Plan has had global leaderboard success for Mega Crab, VP, and 
Warships. A well run Telegram group is needed for highly competitive game play on Boom Beach and this bot was developed 
to organize and run all competive teams.

If you are interested in joining and becoming a member of a CWAP group please refer to the 
[@joincwap](https://t.me/joincwap) Telegram channel.
